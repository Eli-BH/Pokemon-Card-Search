<h4>Pokemon Card Search is a simple search container that allows the user to search for a pokemon and have it appear in it's own flippable pokemon card. </h4>


The project is made using ReactJS and the pokemon api. 
It uses React-card-flip to allow the cards to have a 3d affect 

The styles are all made with basic css.
