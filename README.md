Pokemon Card Search is a simple search container that allows the user to search for a pokemon and have it appear in it's own flippable pokemon card. 


Project is made using ReactJS and the pokemon api. 
It uses React-card-flip to allow the cards to have a 3d affect 

The styles are all made with basic css.

To get the project running, you mush have JavaScript installed as well as React. 
Then all that is needed is to run an -npm install command,

#Errors
The most common error is a Pokemon not found error, this will come up for some newer pokemon if the api is no updated yet.
